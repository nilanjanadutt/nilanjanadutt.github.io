    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Associate Professor of Strategy in the Department of Management and Technology at Bocconi University. I am affiliated with the research centers IEP@BU, BIDSA, and the Director of ICRIOS.<br>
      </p>
      My research focuses on understanding how the decisions and actions of firms impact their natural and political environment. I explore these dynamics in various contexts such as renewable electricity, early-stage entrepreneurship, waste generation, and corporate lobbying. My research has been published in Strategic Management Journal, Management Science, Organization Science and Academy of Management Journal. I am currently an Associate Editor at the Organization Science.<br> 
      </p>
      I have been elected to be a Rep-at-Large for the Knowledge & Innovation Group of the SMS (2015-2017), a member of the Executive Committee for the STR Division of the AoM (2018-2020), and the TIM Division of the AoM (2022-2024). I serve on the editorial board of Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science, and Strategy Science.<br>
      </p>
      My research has received recognition through Bocconi Research Awards in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as Bocconi Research Grants totaling €50,000 in 2015, 2021, and 2022. Recently, I secured a Cariplo Foundation Grant amounting to €197,000 for the period 2024-2026.
